Once reference points have been identified, their performance will be evaluated through simple Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). 

# Work plan

+ A range of stock assessment models, reflecting the available data, will be fitted for each case study, and the goodness of fit evaluated (e.g., residual analysis, prediction skill).
+ A review of reference points and indicators will be conducted based on a variety of assumptions, e.g. MSY based on biomass dynamic stock assessment models, and indicators such as Lopt ,L50 and Lmega for length-based methods. 
+ The performance of these proxy MSY reference points will be compare these using simulation based on FLife. This will allow the power of the methods to detect whether a stock has achieved its targets and avoid its limits. Based on this screening process a set of candidate reference points and assessment methods will be proposed for MSE. 

## MSE

MSE will include a value-of-information (VoI) analysis, where the benefits of collecting better data and new infomation will be evaluated.

First current knowledge and the available information for each case study will be summarised. Then stock assessment methods based on length, abundance and catch data, will be evaluated and alternative management plans and data collection options proposed and evaluated using MSE. As part of this a VoI analysis will also be conducted to show the benefit of reducing uncertainty about life histories and improving data collection.

MSE will evaluate rules of the form C<sub>t+1</sub>=C<sub>t-1</sub>rfb. Initially individual rules i.e. based on index of relative abundance (r), length or Z (f) would be evaluated separately then the benefits of combined rules and the use of various harvest control rules (see Yves and Colms emails).

### Sub-tasks

+ Summarise current knowledge and information     
+ Agree life history parameters, these have been reviewed by Hans, and so we can now finalise the parameters used to condition the OMs and priors based on these.
+ The Observation Error Model needs still need to be finalised. Methods for generating, size, length, catch and survey data are implemented in FLife, the task is to agree how to parameterizse these with the Case Study experts, i.e. current data quality and possible future improvements for use in a VoI analysis.
+Perform stock assessments for each case study using the available data. This will include appropriate goodness of fit diagnostics and sensitivity analysis (see Pons et al.) to compare across stocks, methods and datasets. Methods will include LBSPR, MLZ, db-sra and a biomass dynamic stock assessment.
+ Use the Operating Model is to simulate different data sets using the OEM to run sensitivity analyses based on the priors generated from the life history parameters, e.g. how do the different methods predict trends and stock status to reference points.
+ Once the “best” performing methods have been identified then a series of Operating Models will be agreed to evaluate the performance of the methods as part of a Management Procedure using MSE. Based on the simulations set up MPs of the form Ct+1=Ctrfb, where individual rules are tested first, i.e. the 2/3 rule for catch (r), proxies for F/FMSY based on length, and Harvest Control Rules based on BMSY proxies (b). Evaluate the individual rules rules that combine them.
+ The MPs evaluated will be of the form C[t+1]=C[t-1]rfb. (Fischer et al., in prep). This would be done by evaluate rules of the form C[t+1]=C[t-1]rfb. Initially rules based on an index of relative abundance (r) and length or Z (f) would be evaluated separately then the benefits of combined rules evaluated.
+ To perform the VoI analysis the benefits of improved data collection and knowledge will be evaluated as part of the MSE.
