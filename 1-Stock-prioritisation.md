A number of example species and stocks were identified. The prioritisation and final choice of stocks was based on economic value, importance to the ecosystem, sensitivity to the impacts of fishing, availablity of data and other risks such as vulnerability, data availability, and significant by-catch. 



To help with prioritisation a Productivity Susceptibility Analysis was conducted, following which 6 case studies were selected

+ Mollusc: North Irish Sea razor clam: Contact: Oliver Tully, Yves Reecht
+ Crustacean: West and south coast lobster: Contact: Oliver Tully, Yves Reecht
+ Demersal roundfish: inshore Pollack (area 7) – think of whether to include area 6: Contact: Katie Thomas
+ Demersal flatfish: turbot and brill: Contact: Hans Gerritsen
+ Elasmobranchs: skates and rays in the 7a,f,g (main targeted Irish fishery from 7a): Contact: Maurice Clarke
+ Pelagic: sprat in area 6,7abcfghjk: Contact: Claire Moore and new MI team lead on herring (Michael Gras)

It may not be possible to run all of these (given data, time or other constraints) but a minimum of four will be run with the ambition to run all. Under task 5 a plan will be proposed plan per stock, which will include the main questions and details about the specifications. 

## Candidate species 

The original set of species identified were 

| Species     | TAC | Commercial Data              | Data                     | Comments        |
| ------------|:---:|------------------------------|--------------------------|:------------------:|
| Sprat     | No  |Targeted species for small fleet | Poor; mainly landings weights  | Key-stone prey fish|
| Gurnards  | No  |Nearly 100\% discarded  & Reasonable discard and survey data. No age data | Key-stone prey – widely distributed and abundant|
| Saithe, Pollock Ling | Yes |Mixed fishery | Some port sampling, observer and survey data. Very limited age data | Key-stone predator||
| Rays, Skates  | Yes |Targeted and mixed fishery  | Some port sampling, observer and survey data. No age data | Sensitive species – slow reproduction|
| John Dory | No  |Mixed fishery but can be targeted to an extent | Some port sampling, observer and survey data. No age data | Sensitive species – valuable non-TAC species (not protected by fisheries management)|
| Turbot, Brill | No  |Mixed fishery but can be targeted to an extent | Some port sampling, observer and survey data. Very limited age data | Sensitive species – valuable non-TAC species (not protected by fisheries management)|

## Stocks

ICES defines a [stock](http://www.ices.dk/community/Documents/Advice/Acronyms_and_terminology.pdf) as a part of a fish population usually with a particular migration pattern, specific spawning grounds, and subject to a distinct fishery. In theory, a Unit Stock comprises all the individuals of fish in an area, which are part of the same reproductive process. It is self contained, with no emigration or immigration of individuals from or to the stock. On practical grounds, a fraction of the unit stock is considered a ‘stock’ for management purposes (or a management unit), as long as the results of the assessments and management remain close enough to what they would be on the unit stock.
