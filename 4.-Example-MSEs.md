# Management Strategy Evaluation
Management Procedures

Feedback control

Management of a fish stocks is done using feedback control. 
The stock is assessed using historical data which is used estimate current stock status 
and then to project the stock forward under alternative management regulations for a variety
of hypotheses and system dynamics. This procedure is then repeated in subsequent year to monitor and adjust the impact of management. MSE does this my simulating a MP. These can either be model based or empirical, i.e. based on a stock assessment or data alone.

## Performance measures 

Management objectives include (e.g. under the [Marine Directive](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-3/index_en.htm) of the European Union) that stocks should be exploited sustainably consistent with high long-term yields, have full reproductive capacity in order to maintain stock biomass and that the proportion of older and larger individuals should be maintained (or increased) as they are indicators of a healthy stock

These general objectives can be mapped to performance measures, so that alternative management strategies can be compared. For example

+ **Safety**, Probability of avoiding a limit such as  B<sub>lim;</sub> where recruitment is impaired
+ **Status**, Probability of achieving targets related to MSY, e.g.  B>B<sub>MSY </sub> & F< F<sub>MSY</sub>
+ **Yield**, Yield:MSY
+ **Variability**, Inter-annual variation in catches or stock status

Once an MSE has been run there will be an `FLStock` object, the original reference points are found in the `FLBRP` object.
