Once reference points have been identified, their performance will be evaluated through simple Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE).    

Before conducting the MSE simulation tests were conducted to select the best performing methods identified under [Task 3](https://github.com/flr/mydas/wiki/3-Method-and-simulation-framework-development-and-implementation). 


## Stock Assessment Methods

The stock assessment methods that take these data as inputs have been selected, based on a review of simulation work already conducted (e.g. by ICES); namely
 
## Management Procedure

The assessment methods selected were catch only (bd-sra), catch and indices of abundance (mpb), length frequency (LPSPR) and mean size (MLZ) and a Cat 1 VPA based method.

In addition a number of emprirical, i.e. model free MPs were also tested.

The methods were run as part of a MP, i.e. for a set of pre-agreed data, choice of reference points and Harvest Control Rule using the 7 OMs.
 
## Operating Models

OM conditioning was conducted using [FLife](https://github.com/flr/mydas/blob/master/tasks/task5/R/FLife-OM.pdf) under Tasks [3](https://github.com/flr/mydas/wiki/3-Method-and-simulation-framework-development-and-implementation) and [4](https://github.com/flr/mydas/wiki/4-Method-performance-appraisal).

###  Observation Error Model

The OEM mimic the types of data currently required for each assessment method. In addition the types of a data that could be made available in the future, i.e. to show how to reduce risk by reducing uncertainty. 

The simulated datasets are

+ Catch by year
+ Indices of abundance, both fishery dependent and independent
+ Mean size and length frequency
