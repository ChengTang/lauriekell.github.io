#### Building the simulation models, i.e. conditioning them on data and knowledge, and rejecting and weighting different hypotheses.
#### alternative management strategies, (i.e.the combination of pre-defined data, stock assessment methods, reference points and HCRs.
#### the simulations using the HCRs as feedback control procedures; and
