A variety of stock assessment methods exist for data rich stocks e.g. VPA 
[XSA](http://www.flr-project.org/doc/Stock_assessment_using_eXtended_Survivors_Analysis_with_FLXSA.html), statisical catch at age [a4a](http://www.flr-project.org/doc/Statistical_catch_at_age_models_in_FLa4a.html), and biomass based [mpb]()

In addition a variety of methods have been developed for data limited stocks, for example there are a variety of Length Based Methods such as [MLZ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MLZ/index.html) a R package that estimates Z from mean length and [LBSPR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LBSPR/vignettes/LBSPR.html) is a R package for simulation and estimation using life-history ratios and length composition data.

See the vignettes for [length based](https://github.com/laurieKell/mydas-pkg/blob/master/vignettes/mydas_length.Rmd) for [catch only](https://github.com/laurieKell/mydas-pkg/blob/master/vignettes/mydas_sra.Rmd) based methods.

For simulation testing these can be run in the form of Management Procedures [To Do]()
